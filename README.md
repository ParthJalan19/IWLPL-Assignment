Form validate form using JavaScript, CSS, HTML and a simple python script
I built a Form validate form using JavaScript, CSS, HTML 
1)In this I used HTML to make to label and input for the form 
2)CSS is used to position the elements (eg. Contact form in middle of the page in which text-allign is ussed by selecting 'h2' .)
3)Javascript done the backpart for the form 
  (i)In which  targeting is done as form "id = contactForm" is  selected and eventlistener is done as the submit button is clicked the defined ananonymous function "event"  which is directly enter as a parameter which is triggered        and then the name and email is trimed as the no white space is left.
  (ii)Then the condition statement is used to verify if name or email is missing or both are missing 
        then second condition if '@' is not present in email which is done using "email.include("@").
        and last condition that includes all conditiion we need is approved then it prints -> "Success! Form submitted".
